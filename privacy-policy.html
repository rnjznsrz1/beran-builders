<h1>R.A 10173 "DATA PRIVACY ACT OF 2012"</h1>


<h1>• The Republic Act 10173, officially known as the Data Privacy Act of 2012 (DPA), is Philippine’s data privacy law, aiming to “to protect the fundamental human right of privacy, of communication while ensuring free flow of information to promote innovation and growth” while also ensuring “that personal information in information and communications systems in the government and in the private sector are secured and protected.” The law became enforceable as of September 8, 2012 and the regulating authority, the NPC, was established 4 years later, in 2016. As of September 9, 2016 the NPC published ‘Implementing Rules and Regulations of Republic Act No. 10173, known as the Data Privacy Act of 2012,’ or the IRR, to help with the understanding of the requirements imposed on covered entities.
